# Crest Optimizer
This mod includes an assortment of customizable 
settings for optimizing the Crests to your personal
preferences. 

These settings can be accessed using
the Bepinex Config menu (F1). Each setting defaults to
the "vanilla" version seen in the game, so you won't 
see any special effects until you make changes in the 
menu.

## Settings List
### Hunter Crest
#### Lv 2 - Focus Hits 
The number of hits required to achieve Focus with 
Hunter Crest at Level 2
#### Lv 2 - Focus Modifier

### Reaper Crest
#### Silk Count
Multiplies the number of Silk "fragments" produced
by the Reaper Crest while in bind mode
#### Silk Value

reference, by default it takes 3 fragments to gain
1 point of Silk.

### Wanderer Crest
#### Critical Hit Chance
Percent chance of a critical hit (ie. 2 = 2%)
#### Critical Hit Damage Bonus
Multiplies the damage dealt by a critical hit
#### Extra Red Slot
Replaces the bottom yellow slot with a red slot,
allowing for 2 attack tools to be equipped

### Beast Crest
#### Down Slash I-Frames
Applies invincibility to the start of the down slash
#### Fury Heal Cap
The maximum number of masks that can be healed with a
single bind
#### Beast Dash
Removes drop from down slash, turning it into a dash 
attack
#### Beast Pogo
Removes forward movement from down slash, turning it
into a vertical dive attack
#### Up Slash Size
Increases the range of the up slash
- NOTE: I am aware that in the code I multiply the
x & y scales by the opposite config scales. This is on
purpose so the x-multiplier affects the horizontal 
scale, and vice versa.

### Witch Crest
#### Tentacle Size
Increases the range of the bind tentacles
#### Tentacle Size (Longclaw)
Increases the range of the bind tentacles when
Longclaw is equipped
#### Witch Heal Cap
The maximum number of masks that can be healed with a
single bind
#### Witch Silk Refund
Refunds some Silk if the bind doesn't hit any targets,
and therefore doesn't restore any masks
#### Double Mirrors
When Multibinder is equipped, Claw Mirror(s) triggers
twice

### Architect Crest
#### Extra Shard Drop
Percent chance of enemies dropping Shell Shards on a 
successful attack
#### Craft Masks
The number of masks restored by Craft Bind
#### Craft Bind Default
Swaps the activation requirements for Bind and Craft
Bind, making Craft Bind the default

### Shaman Crest
#### No Drop Bind
Disables the "drop" step of the bind, allowing for
mid-air binds
